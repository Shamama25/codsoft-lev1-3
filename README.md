This project is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator includes a display screen to show user input and results. The layout is implemented using CSS grid system for button alignments. Event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops are utilized to handle user input and perform calculations.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the calculator.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Display screen to show user input and results.

## How It Works

The calculator application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Event listeners are attached to each button to capture user input. JavaScript functions handle the logic for performing calculations based on the user's input. The result is displayed dynamically on the screen.
